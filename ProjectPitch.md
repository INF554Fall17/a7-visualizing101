1.The Issue:
One of the biggest health concerns facing our generation is the threat of cancer. Our project is a way of raising 
awareness and communicating the importance of early detection in order to get successful treatment. (Image: Front Page)

2 and 3. Interesting/Important:
The importance of cancer awareness cannot be overstated. Recognizing possible warning signs of cancer and taking prompt 
action leads to early diagnosis. Increased awareness of possible warning signs of cancer among people can have a 
great impact in fighting against the disease. (Image: 1 in 3 / 1 in 4)

4. Audience:
This is an issue that affects 1 out of 3 people globally, and thus is directed towards everyone. Our aim is to reiterate 
the growing threat of cancer, emphasize the importance of early diagnosis and encourage people to take as many 
preventive measures as they possibly can.(Image: Audience)

5 and 6. Visualization Useful/ Compare with what others have done:

Our project is useful as it helps to start and encourage conversation about cancer.There are many charts/plots/reports out there with the topic of cancer on them. We plan to go a step ahead in many ways. Firstly, it is a combination of cancer risks, how it has spread, the mortality as well as the survivor rate, preventive measures - all together in 1 website. Secondly, we are presenting it on a easy-on-the-eyes awesome website. Finally, we have a ton of interactive visualizations that the user can click on/play around with to get a better understanding and awareness of this pressing topic.(Image: Cool)

7 and 8. Story:

We visualize our Fight Against Cancer by coming up with numerous intercative visualizations using all the graphs out there - bar chart, line charts, scatter plots - if there is one, we have it! We measure the trends in cancer mortality rate, according to the cancer type, age group, sex of the person etc. We also show how the medical technologies that have come up help in the cancer survival rate, the success rate of the research centers around the world fighting to find the best possible cure. We strive to provide all the information you would need all in one place - and a super cool website to go with it! (Image: Steps)

9. Technologies Used:

We plan to use a host of technologies to come up with our awesome webiste! (Talk about each)(Image: Tech)

10. Design Consideration / Evaluation:

Ideal visualization wheel - COmpare our website viz wheel for evaluation.
Using visualization wheel for good design.

Evaluate using feedback provided by friends, classmates, TA & Professor.

11. Deliverables:
Our deliverables would be:
1) The datasets collected (we plan to make some of them according to the verbal information online).
2) The Visualizations we have created - in the form of a website. 
3) Paper
4) Demo/Video
5) Final Presentation

12. Working together:
This project sure is a fun way to make friends! We have distributed the work among us equally. While the visualizations are done by all of us together, we are splitting up the data we will be using. For our datasets, we will start from data pre-processing, cleaning, analysis, visualizing and website integration. (Image: WorkingTogether)
13 and 14.Timelines:
Our project is spread out over the course of the next 6-7 weeks ending with the paper, demo, video and final presentation. (Now, talk a bit about each step and the technology you can use)(Image: 2)
15. Thank you slide:
Thank you for taking your time to join us in our fight against cancer. In conclusion we would like to say that apart from the many many awesome visualizations we plan to have, we are also planning to do a little bit of analysis to make the webiste more attractive and interactive - with some analysis and predicitions to help in raising awareness.
